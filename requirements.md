# Arogya Mitra AI Chatbot Requirements

## The Problem

Beneficiaries and stakeholders of the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) scheme often face challenges in understanding their eligibility, locating hospitals, getting real-time status of their claims, and navigating the application or scheme processes. Currently, the absence of instant, user-friendly support creates confusion and delays in availing healthcare benefits.

We are targeting the "last-mile information and support gap." Services and benefits exist, but the right information, guidance, or help does not effectively reach the people who need it most. Many users, especially those who are less tech-savvy, illiterate, or living in rural/remote areas struggle to obtain timely, accurate answers to basic questions (eligibility, benefits, processes, claim status) and guidance on how to utilize the Ayushman Bharat scheme effectively.

## The User

**Primary:** Eligible and existing Ayushman Bharat beneficiaries, including those in rural, semi-urban, and urban India.
- **Scale and Impact:** As of early 2026, over 500 million individuals (50 crore+, source: Government of India) are listed as potential beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat. An estimated 60%+ (300 million+) beneficiaries reside in rural and semi-urban regions, where access to reliable, timely, and localized information is limited.

The proposed AI assistant directly empowers these users by providing 24×7, multilingual, conversational access to Ayushman Bharat information and support.

**Secondary:** Hospital administrative staff and Ayushman Bharat customer support agents involved in patient onboarding, eligibility verification, and claim coordination also handle large volumes of repetitive beneficiary queries.

The solution reduces operational burden by automating FAQs, eligibility checks, and guidance, allowing staff to focus on complex cases.

**Tertiary:** Community health workers (ASHAs) supporting beneficiaries at the village level.

The proposed solution will act as a trusted AI knowledge companion for accurate, real-time assistance.

## The AI Edge

The challenges faced by Ayushman Bharat beneficiaries are not caused by a lack of policies or platforms, but by complexity, scale, and diversity at the last mile. Traditional solutions like static websites, IVR menus, or human helplines fail to meet these realities.

AI is essential because:
- Human-dependent support does not scale to serve 50 crore+ beneficiaries, especially during peak healthcare needs.
- Information needs are highly varied and contextual, making fixed workflows and FAQs inadequate.
- Users often do not know what to ask, requiring an intelligent system that can understand intent and guide conversations naturally.
- Timely guidance directly impacts health outcomes, where delays or misinformation can lead to denied care or missed benefits.

AI uniquely addresses these constraints by acting as an always-available, adaptive, and inclusive interface, capable of interpreting user intent, simplifying complex scheme rules, and delivering reliable guidance at scale.

Without AI, the last-mile information and support gap persists; with AI, access to healthcare benefits becomes equitable, immediate, and human-like, even for the most underserved populations.

## The Success Metric

The success of the AI-powered Ayushman Bharat chatbot will be measured through **impact, adoption, and efficiency** at the last mile.

### Beneficiary Impact
- **Reduction in information gaps:** Fewer repeated queries and confusion around eligibility, benefits, hospital discovery, and claim status.
- **Improved accessibility:** High usage across rural and semi-urban users, including non–tech-savvy and low-literacy populations.
- **Faster resolution:** Reduced time taken for beneficiaries to get accurate answers or guidance.

### Adoption & Reach
- **User adoption:** Number of unique beneficiaries actively using the chatbot.
- **Language coverage:** Successful interactions across multiple Indian languages.
- **Repeat usage:** Beneficiaries returning to the chatbot for ongoing support.

### Operational Efficiency
- **Reduced support load:** Decrease in calls and tickets handled by Ayushman Bharat helplines.
- **Automation rate:** High percentage of queries resolved without human intervention.
- **Consistent accuracy:** Reliable, up-to-date responses aligned with guidelines.

### System-Level Outcomes
- **Scalability:** Ability to serve large user volumes during peak demand without degradation.
- **Trust & reliability:** Positive feedback from beneficiaries.

**A win is achieved when the chatbot becomes the first point of help for Ayushman Bharat users reducing confusion, saving time, and ensuring that healthcare benefits truly reach the last mile.**
